BookBot is a lightweight application designed to read text files (specifically books) and return a report on the amount of words in the document, as well as list that contains the usage of each letter in the book.

The application was designed with the goal of putting my learnings of Python into practice in a practical way. I used the boot.dev learning path for reference.
